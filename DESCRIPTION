Description: RepViz enables the view of a genomic region in a simple and 
            efficient way. RepViz allows simultaneous viewing of both 
            intra- and intergroup variation in sequencing counts of the 
            studied conditions, as well as their comparison to the output 
            features (e.g. identified peaks) from user selected data analysis 
            methods.The RepViz tool is primarily designed for chromatin data 
            such as ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, but can also be used with other 
            sequencing data such as RNA-seq, or combinations of different 
            types of genomic data.
